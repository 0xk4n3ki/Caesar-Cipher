# Caesar-Cipher

The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”.

It works by using a deafult set of characters, i.e. : "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".
